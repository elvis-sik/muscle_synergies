The synergy analysis supported by this package consists of preprocessing the EMG signal and factoring the resulting matrix. :cite:t:`abcofemg` introduces electromiography, including a presentation of the experimental procedure. :cite:t:`emgtutorial` and :cite:t:`robbins2014` both focus more specifically on analyzing the EMG signal.
Beginners in signal processing seeking to understand the role that the different filters play in the EMG analysis might benefit from reading the discussion by :cite:t:`filtertutorial`.

:cite:t:`dAvella2009` introduces synergy models in the context of motor control.
Readers interested in discussions of possible neural origins for synergies and alternative modular models of motor control might be interested in reading the articles by :cite:t:`Bizzi2013` and :cite:t:`Berret2016`.

It seems like there are not many tutorials focused specifically on synergy analysis.
:cite:t:`chapter5` provides an useful discussion, mostly focused on the difference between 2 dimensionality reduction methods, PCA and NMF (nonnegative matrix factorization).
There are though many empirical papers describing the analysis in their "Methods" section, including the one by :cite:t:`Rabbi2020`, which concluded that NMF is superior to alternative methods to find synergies.
