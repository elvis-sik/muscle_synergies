        trecho. For more on how they work and what is supported, refer to
        :py:meth:`Segmenter.get_times_of`.

        The data columns are specified with the parameters `device_type`,
        `device_inds` and `col`.  The first, `device_type` is one of `"force
        plate"`, `"traj"` and `"emg"`.  The second, `device_inds`, if given, is
        a sequence of indices referring to which devices, out of the list of
        all of them, should be picked. Finally, the third, `col`, is the label

            considered if there are at least `min_phase_size` measurements
            displaying the relevant property. For example, only if there are
            `min_phase_size` measurements with `0.0` on the left force plate
            and a negative value on the right one.

        num_segments: number of segments to be looked for. If `0`, find as many
            segments as possible and return them.

    Returns:
        a sequence of indices. The first index will be 0, corresponding to the
        start of the signal in which a single force plate is measuring ground
        reaction. The next index will be the start of the first "trecho", when
        both force plates have a reaction.

    Raises:
        ValueError if a segment with the desired property (e.g., just a single
            leg active) could not be found. Generally this would mean that the
            parsing process got too close to the end of the measurements.
            Decreasing `min_phase_size` might help. If `num_segments` is equal
            to 0, this should never happen.

        IndexError if the end of the input (`left_reaction` and
            `right_reaction`) was reached before `num_segments` were
            identified. If `num_segments == 0`, this should never happen.

# NEXT TODO
# 1. DONE Make `organize_transitions` return slices of `FrameSubfr` instead of
#    indices somehow

# 2. Then `Segmenter` needs to learn to work with that. Advantage will be to
#    support different `DeviceData`.
#
#    Segmenter just returns slices now, it becomes simpler and cares much less
#    about its data. It does nota make sense anymore for it to have
#    `left_reaction`, for example.

# 3. Make `ViconNexusData` be able to fetch a bunch of data at once. I.e., what
#    I was trying to make `Segmenter` do.

# 4. Then I have to fix `SegmentPlotter`. It very much needs to concern itself
#    with force plates.

# 5. Finally, I test everything:
#    - Run the test suite
#    - Run the Jupyter Notebooks, including the interactive one
#    - Regenerate docs and see if the `FrameSubfr` thing worked. Try to use C-f
#      to see if the definition of `Segments` occur anywhere in the docs. If
#      they do, think about fixing that.
#    - Manually test it. Get the data for all trechos 1 and 3 BL then for all
#      trechos 2 and 4. Compute synergies.
