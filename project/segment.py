            reaction) and the left one oscillates a bit close to 0. For
            example, in adjacent subframes the left measurements could go like
            `0.0, `-24.7177, 0.0`. Since the detection of transitions happens
            by noticing when the number of force plates with nonzero

        reaction. The next index will be the start of the first "trecho", when
        both force plates have a reaction.

        ValueError if a segment with the desired property (e.g., just a single

            Decreasing `min_phase_size` might help. If `num_segments` is equal
            to 0, this should never happen.

        IndexError if the end of the input (`left_reaction` and
